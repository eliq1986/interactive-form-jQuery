# Interactive Form

Enhanced a interactive registration form for a fictional conference utilizing popular jQuery library to complete this project. This project was done previously with vanilla js with less features. With **Query** I was able to keep this project in the low 300's and more readable with more features.


# Browser Compatible
- **Chrome**
